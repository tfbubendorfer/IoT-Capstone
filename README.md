# IoT-Capstone
GitHub repository for the EdX IoT capstone project

Please note: I deleted "unneccessary" services from my resource group when I moved from lab 1 oto lab 2 (data lake, data lake analytics, function, storage). I then read on the forum that we were supposed to leave them in and mereely add new services for lab 2. I subsequqnetly re-created those services and tested them - they seem to work justr fine - but they are not the same as originally used in lab 1.

The exported ARM template for lab 1 was created by the original setup. I have not touched any submitted lab 1 files.
